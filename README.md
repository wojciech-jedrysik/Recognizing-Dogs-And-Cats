# Recognizing-Dogs-And-Cats
It is the source code of the application that loads the image selected by the user, displays it and informs the user whether it is a dog or a cat. The program uses an artificial neural network that has been trained to recognize these two animals.

From this link you can download the dataset I used, as well as the neural network model I trained:

IMPORTANT! The model only recognizes dogs and cats, if the picture you send is completely different, the program will display information that it is a dog or a cat.
